This project demonstrates the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier using a synthetically generated dataset. It is designed as a simple and clear example of supervised machine learning for classification tasks.

üîç Overview
Generate an artificial dataset using scikit-learn's make_classification function.

Preprocess and visualize the dataset.

Train a Decision Tree Classifier.

Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualize the decision boundaries and the tree structure.
